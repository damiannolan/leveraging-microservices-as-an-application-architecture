## Abstract

*Microservice Architecture is an approach in software engineering and design that aims to divide an application into
small constituents that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled. The following paper is intended to give an overview and
exploration into the architectural style. Microservice Architecture has gained extensive exposure in the last number of
years - Throughout this paper we will introduce Microservice Architecture as a concept, discuss Microservices as a
subset of Service Orientated Architecture (SOA), compare and contrast Microservices with traditional Monolithic
Architecture and review Docker, as a containerization platform for building Microservice applications.*
